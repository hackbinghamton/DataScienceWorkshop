    "\n",
    "We're more interested in seeing how these factors correlate with one another. Some questions we might ask might be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Were people who paid for higher-class service more likely to survive?\n",

    "\n",
    "We can also use `.groupby` with multiple labels! Just use the format `dataframe.groupby([\"Column1\", \"Column2\", ...])`. With this sort of flexibility, we can answer our fourth question from above:"

    "\n",
    "Now, what if we want to look at such information, but only look at certain regions of the data? For example, if we were trying to answer our second question, we'd only really like to look at those under a certain range in the Age column.\n",
