# HackBU - Data Science & Engineering

<!-- ## Getting Started -->

<!-- In this workshop, we'll be covering two very hot topics in tech - data science and data engineering. The difference between these two fields is complicated and oftentimes blurry, but the difference can be summarized as follows: -->

<!-- * Data Science involves analyzing data to establish trends/patterns and make decisions. -->

<!-- * Data Engineering involves transporting and cleaning data so that it can be used for analysis. -->
