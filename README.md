# HackBU - Data Science & Engineering

## Getting Started

In this workshop, we'll be covering two very hot topics in tech - data science and data engineering. The difference between these two fields is complicated and oftentimes blurry, but the difference can be summarized as follows:

* Data Science involves analyzing data to establish trends/patterns and make decisions.

* Data Engineering involves transporting and cleaning data so that it can be used for analysis.
